# 🎉 Quizzical — A Trivia Quiz App (Scrimba Project)

A fun and dynamic quiz app built during my journey through the **Scrimba React course**. This project helped me deepen my understanding of React fundamentals like state, props, hooks, and component architecture — all while making something playful and interactive.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

This is a simple, single-page React app that pulls trivia questions from the [Open Trivia Database (OTDB)](https://opentdb.com/) and lets the user test their knowledge in a slick UI.

---

## 📌 Core Features

* 🎬 **Two-Screen Flow**

  * Welcome screen to start the game
  * Question screen with randomized multiple-choice questions

* 📡 **Dynamic Question Fetching**

  * Pulls **5 multiple-choice questions** from the OTDB API on each game load

* ✅ **Answer Checking**

  * Highlights correct and incorrect answers when the player clicks **“Check Answers”**

* 🔄 **Replayability**

  * Fully resets with new questions when the user clicks **“Play Again”**

---

## 🌟 Stretch Goals I Implemented

* ✨ **UI Animation with GSAP**

  * Added smooth motion and interactive feedback to enhance the experience

* ♿ **Accessibility Improvements**

  * Keyboard-navigable, screen-reader-friendly markup and labels

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **React**
* **GSAP** (for motion)
* **HTML Entities Decoder** (to clean API question strings)
* **OpenTDB API**
* **clsx**

## 💡 What I Learned

* Managing state across components using `useState` and `useEffect`
* Handling form inputs in React (controlled components)
* Mapping API data into clean, user-friendly UI
* Animating React elements with GSAP
* Accessibility 

---

## 🧪 Future Improvements (if I revisit)

* Category & difficulty selectors
* Timed mode or score leaderboard
* Sound effects or animations for answer feedback

## 🧑‍💻 Made by a UX / UI Developer Learning Creatively

This project was built not just to learn React, but to have fun doing it. It combines learning with creativity, which is what Scrimba encourages — and what I value most in coding.
